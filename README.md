## Introduction

_HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-Clevergig_ is a _source_ connector. _Clevergig_ provides a set of REST API's that allow you to programmatically interact with its data. _Clevergig_ represents a system where gigs (tasks or jobs) are assigned to workers who fulfill specific roles. The work done on these gigs is logged in worklogs.

## Getting started

### How to interpret the data

#### Gig

A gig represents a task or job. In this dataset, each gig can be related to multiple workers, roles, and worklogs.

The _gig_ data set is split into two arrays: <br> - Data (contains all the gigs) <br> - Includes (basic role, worker and worklog information.)

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "001",

        "approver_id": null,
        "planner_distance": "63.72"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Role

A role represents the job position or responsibility a worker has within a gig. Each gig can have multiple roles, and a worker may hold several roles across different gigs. However, it's uncommon for a worker to hold multiple roles within the same gig.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "002",
      "type": "role",
      "attributes": {
        "id": 002,
        "title": "Helpende"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Worker

A worker is the individual assigned to complete a gig. A gig can have multiple workers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Worker information is only accessible within a gig through the [_included/workers/worker_](#gig) array.

```json
{
  "id": "003",
  "type": "worker",
  "attributes": {
    "id": 003,
    "first_name": "Emma",
    "last_name": "Brown",
    "phone": "",
    "email": "ebrown@enyoi",
    "status": "active",
    "external_id": 123456,
    "created_at": "2024-05-17T12:17:43.000Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-10-28T09:24:35.000Z",
    "short_description": null,
    "birthdate": null
  },
  "relationships": {
    "roles": {
      "data": [
        {
          "id": "002",
          "type": "role"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Worklog

A worklog is a record that tracks the time a worker has spent on a gig, along with its status (such as approved or draft) and the approverâ€™s information. In Clevergig, worklogs are linked to both workers and gigs, serving as the central object that connects gig, worker, and organizational data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Within the connector, worklogs are retrieved and filtered based on the `organizationId` from a CSV mapping.
> Worklogs are transferred to a _worklogDTO_ object containing the following:
> - `OrganizationId`
> - `GigId`
> - `WorkerId`

```json
{
    "id": "004",
    "type": "worklog",
    "attributes": {
        "id": 004,
        "worker_id": 003,
    }
}
```

### CSV mapping

An additional CSV mapping file is utilized to extract the `CostCenterCode`. The process involves: retrieving all worklogs for a specific organization, matching each worklog with the worker by checking the `worklogid` and `worker_id`. Upon a successful match, the `organizationId` is used to lookup the corresponding `CostCenterCode` within the CSV file.

```csv
Id;CostCenterCode
005;ORG-1
```
> [!WARNING]
> The `CostCenterCode` is only available if the contract is of type `gig`.

### UML

For a visual representation of the relationships between the different entities and a _HelloID_ person/contract, refer to the UML diagram below:

![uml](./umlCleverGig.png)

### The proces in-depth

#### 1. Import CSV mapping
- __Goal__: Import additional mapping to allow for lookups by `organizationid` to complete the contract information with the correct `CostCenterCode`.

#### 2. Retrieve all roles
- __Goal__: Retrieve all available roles to allow for lookups by `roleid` to complete the contract information with the correct `Title`. The roles are stored in the `allRoles` list.

#### 3. Retrieve arganizations and worklogs
   - __Goal__: Retrieve all organizations and their associated worklogs, then filter them based on a specified date range.
   - __Process__:
     - Retrieve all organizations using the `Invoke-ClevergigRestMethod` with the `organizations?` endpoint.
     - For each organization:
       - Retrieve the worklogs by calling the `worklogs?by_organizations` endpoint, applying the date range filters (`start_date` and `finish_date`).
       - For each worklog in the retrieved data:
         - Create a DTO object (`$organizationWorklogDTO`) containing the `OrganizationId`, `logId`, and `WorkerId`.
         - Add the DTO object to the `$allWorklogsDTO` list for further processing.

#### 4. Retrieve worklogs per organization and filter on date range
- __Goal__: Retrieve all worklogs for a specific organization and filter by a date range. The date range is determined by the days specified in the configuration settings:
  - `HistoricalDays`
  - `FutureDays`

#### 5. Retrieve gigs, associated data and filter on date range
   - __Goal__: Retrieve gigs along with their related roles, workers, and worklogs. The data is filter by a date range. The date range is determined by the days specified in the configuration settings:
  - `HistoricalDays`
  - `FutureDays`
   - __Data structure__:
     - `Data`: An array containing:
       - __id__: Unique identifier for each gig.
       - __type__: Type of data entry.
       - __attributes__: Contains details such as `status` and `date`.
       - __relationships__: Lists linked objects, including:
         - `roles`
         - `workers`
         - `worklogs`
     - `Includes`: An array containing basic information for:
       - `role`
       - `worker`
       - `worklog`

#### 6. Separate the gigs and associated data into lists
  - __Goal__: Separate the gigs and the included array into different lists for easier processing.

#### 7. Gather all workers
   - __Goal__: Build a list of all workers associated with each gig.
   - __Process__:
     - Loop through `gig.relationships.workers` to collect all workers.
     - For each worker:
       - Look up the `worker` object in `includes` by matching `id` and `type`.
       - Add each worker to a list for further processing.

#### 8. Process all workers
   - __Goal__: For every worker, build up the full `person` object.
   - __Process__:
     - For each worker:
       - Retrieve the gigs associated with them and lookup the worker details in the __includes__ array.
       - __Contract Details__:
         - __Duration__: Use the `date` field (start and end dates) of each gig as the contract period.
         - __Cost Center__: Derived from a CSV lookup based on `worklog/organization.id`.
         - __Title__: Retrieved from the roles data using `title.id`.

#### 9. Retrieve worklogs and associate CostCenter details
   - __Goal__: Retrieve all worklogs for a specific worker and gig, then associate the corresponding cost center details from a CSV mapping.
   - __Process__:
     - Loop through all `worklogsDTO` to find logs that match the `workerGig.relationships.worklogs.data.id` and `worker.workerId`.
     - For each matching worklog:
       - Add the worklog to the `$gigDTOWorklogs` list.
     - Retrieve the `organizationId` from the first matching worklog in the list.
     - If the `organizationId` is found:
       - Look up the corresponding cost center details in the `$costCenterCodes` CSV mapping file by matching the `organizationId`.
       - Extract the following cost center details:
         - `Id`
         - `Title`
         - `LocatiesAdressen`
         - `IntusResourceGroupId`
         - `FactureringKostenplaats`
       - Store the extracted details in the `$gigContract.CostCenterDetails` object for further processing.

#### 10. Get title information by looking up the `roleid` within the allRoles list
   - __Goal__: Retrieve the role information associated with a gig and set the gig contract title based on the role.
   - __Process__:
     - Check if the `gig.relationships.roles.data` is not null.
     - If roles are present:
       - Use the role ID from `gig.relationships.roles.data[0].id` to find the matching role in the `allRoles` list.
       - Set the `Title` of the `$gigContract` to the `title` attribute of the matching role.

#### 11. Construct the startDate and endDate
   - __Goal__: Set the start and end dates for the gig contract based on the worker gig's date.
   - __Process__:
     - Parse the `workerGig.attributes.date` using the format `"dd-MM-yyyy"` to set the `StartDate` of the `$gigContract`.
     - Set the `EndDate` of the `$gigContract` to one day after the `StartDate`, subtracting one second to ensure it reflects the end of the day.

#### 12. Complete person object with contract informtion
   - __Goal__: Create the contract objects for both the _gig_ and _role_ type contracts.

### API endpoints

The following endpoints are used by the connector

| Endpoint       | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |

| /gigs          | Retrieve information about gigs. The data set is split into two arrays: <br> - Data (gigs) <br> - Includes (basic roles information, workers, and basic worklog information)             |
| /roles         | Retrieve all available roles. <br> Since the _/gigs/includes/roles_ only contains the `role.id`, we need to look up specific information within the full _role_ object.                  |
| /worklogs/{id} | Retrieve information about worklogs. <br> Since the _/gigs/includes/worklogs_ only contains basic worklog information, we need the full _worklog_ object to extract organizational data. |
